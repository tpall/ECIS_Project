Electric cell-substrate impedance assay

The measurement of cell layer resistance was performed using ECIS Zθ and 96WE1_PET plates (Applied Biophysics, Troy, NY, USA). Before use, 96-well plate was pretreated with 10 mM cysteine (200 μl/well) for 12 min at RT, washed 2 times with PBS (175 μl/well) and thereafter coated with 0.1% gelatin in 150 mM NaCl (200 μl/well) for 1 h at RT. 

HUVEC were seeded at density 5000 cells/well. After 30 h cells were switched to starvation media – M199 supplemented with 1% FBS, 25 mM Hepes and 4 mM L-glutamine for overnight (15-16 hours). After starvation, cells were treated with different concentrations of hIgG-Fc or CD44-3MUT-Fc in 155 μl of 5% FBS containing HUVEC growth media (5% FBS, M199, 4 mM L-glutamine, 12.5 μg/ml heparin, 10 mM Hepes, 7.5 μg/ml ECGS) for 1 hour at 37°C. Thereafter the cells were stimulated with VEGF, FGF2, GDF2 or HGF. For that 20 μl of 8.75 × growth factor solution in 5% FBS containing HUVEC growth media was added to cells, so that final media volume was 175 μl/well. The growth of stimulated HUVEC was further monitored in ECIS for at least 72 hours at 37°C.

All experiment data was exported from ECIS Software to xls file using export to Excel command.
